It sounds like you may be experiencing sleep deprivation. Here are a few things you can try to improve your sleep quality:\n\n1. Stick to a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends.\n\n2. Create a bedtime routine to help signal to your body that it's time to sleep.\n\n3. Limit your exposure to screens before bedtime.\n\n4. Create a sleep-conducive environment, such as keeping the room cool, dark, and quiet.\n\n5. Avoid consuming caffeine, alcohol, and heavy meals close to bedtime.\n\n6. Practice relaxation techniques before bed, such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation.\n\n7. If you continue to struggle with sleep, consider talking to a healthcare professional for additional support.\n\nRemember, getting enough sleep is essential for your mental and physical health.\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdin","text":"Propmt:  thank you mently goodbye\n"},{"name":"stdout","text":"<|system|>\nYou are a mental health chatbot that listens and provides helpful advice.</s>\n<|user|>\nthank you mently goodbye</s>\n<|assistant|>\nYou're welcome!
