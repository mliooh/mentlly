# Mentlly: Mental Health Chatbot

This project is a mental health chatbot designed to provide helpful responses to users seeking advice or emotional support. It uses the Hugging Face `zephyr-7b-alpha` model for text generation.

## Project Overview

Mently listens to users' prompts and responds with helpful advice tailored to mental health contexts. Due to the resource constraints of running GPU-heavy models locally, the app runs on a Kaggle notebook where free GPUs are available for execution.

## How to Run

1. Run the chatbot using the notebook on Kaggle:

Visit the Kaggle notebook link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/navillee/mentlly.

Run the cells to interact with the chatbot.

## Alternatively, run the model locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/mliooh/mentlly.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
